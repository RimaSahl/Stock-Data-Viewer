# Demo
A demo application built in React.
Deployed here: [https://stock-data-viewer.vercel.app/](https://stock-data-viewer.vercel.app/).

It Shows stock market data (fake, random data, just to simulate) in the form of line and bar chart.

## How to Use
    Enter a Stock Symbol: Type the desired stock symbol (e.g., AAPL for Apple Inc.) into the input field.
    Select a Time Interval: Choose a time interval for the stock data from the dropdown menu. Options include:
        1 Minute
        30 Minutes
        60 Minutes
    Fetch Data: Click the "Fetch Stock Data" button to retrieve the latest stock information. While the data is loading, the button will display a loading message.
    View Chart: Once the data is fetched, a chart displaying the stock's open, high, low, close, and volume details will be presented below the input fields.
    Error Handling: If there is an issue fetching the data (e.g., an invalid symbol), an error message will appear to inform you.
